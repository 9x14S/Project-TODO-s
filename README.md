[ ] - Conway's Game of Life simulator with `ncurses`
    [ ] - Try to figure out how to implement map compression to represent the
            biggest possible map with the least amount of memory. Maybe explore
            compression algorithms too.

[ ] - Snake game with `ncurses`.

[ ] - GBMU project from the 42 old Outer Core.

[ ] - Lisp interpreter.

[ ] - Extend esolangs.py with some more esoteric languages. Implement LOLCODE.

[ ] - Research and plan "Project Pioneer" (hehehe).

[ ] - Research and plan "Project Rigor" (hehehe).

[ ] - Research and plan "Project Minimal Computing" (hehehe).

[ ] - Create a TinyELF.

[ ] - Create a personal 42 profiler/instrumentation for project testing.
    [ ] - Include allocation tracking and memory efficiency checker utils.

[ ] - Learn how to make quick fuzzers for 42 project testing.
